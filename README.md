üìå Project Overview
GRASSHOPPER-09 is a cutting-edge AI-powered fashion recommendation system that crafts personalized outfit suggestions based on user input. By harnessing the power of Machine Learning (ML) and Generative AI, this platform delivers fashion insights, trend-based recommendations, and interactive AI chat support. 
Users can describe their desired fashion look, and the system generates both images and text-based recommendations, all while integrating an AI-driven chat feature for style guidance.
This document delves into the business strategy and technical infrastructure behind GRASSHOPPER-09, offering insights into its backend functionality, ML model, and overall deployment.

The backend leverages ML models to analyse user preferences and generate outfit recommendations. The pipeline consists of:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Preparation
‚Ä¢	Synthetic dataset containing fashion styles, colours, and occasions
‚Ä¢	Data pre-processing using pandas
‚Ä¢	Feature encoding for categorical variables
2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training (Random Forest Classifier)
‚Ä¢	Features: Style, Colour, Occasion
‚Ä¢	Labels: Outfit Type
‚Ä¢	Model: RandomForestClassifier with n_estimators=100
‚Ä¢	Saves trained model as fashion_model.pkl
3Ô∏è‚É£ Fashion Image Generation (DALL¬∑E 3 API)
‚Ä¢	Converts textual fashion descriptions into AI-generated images
‚Ä¢	Uses OpenAI's DALL¬∑E 3 API to generate visuals
4Ô∏è‚É£ AI Chatbot (GPT-4)
‚Ä¢	Enhances user experience by remembering outfit history
‚Ä¢	Helps users refine their selections and understand fashion trends
‚Ä¢	Stores past interactions in st.session_state.chat_history
5Ô∏è‚É£ Recommendation & Optimization
‚Ä¢	Generates a fashion store search link to find similar real-world outfits
‚Ä¢	Future optimization using Reinforcement Learning (RL) for personalized styling
